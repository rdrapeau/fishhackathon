Fish Hackathon TODO:

DATASETS REQUIRED:
- Scraper setup
	- https://github.com/pevers/images-scraper

- Fish Detection Dataset
	- Optimize for images with lots of background if possible (SVM algorithm uses all the rest of the image except the BB as "negative" examples)
    - Save into one folder
    - Run dlib/tools/imglab to generate training.xml which defines the bounding boxes
    	- https://github.com/davisking/dlib/tree/master/tools/imglab
    - http://dlib.net/train_object_detector.py.html to generate detector svm file.
    - Utilize detector SVM file as a standalone fish detector

- Washington Fish pictures
	- (ideally people holding fish or real fish, not illustration)
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_freshwater_fishes_of_Washington
	- Scrape fish scientific names
	- Run google image scraper (should be something out there for this) on each fish scientific name
	- Run Fish detector developed above to crop out backgrounfad, if detector fails, skip image.
	- Save the fish into separate folders organized by identity (e.g. GoldenTrout/1.jpg ....)

- Informational Data
	- Get Genus and Species (scientific names from above)
	- https://fishbase.ropensci.org/species?Genus=Labroides&species=bicolor
	- Returns a JSON
	- Cache JSON files

TRAIN CLASSIFIER:
- Transfer learning Features (Torch, Caffe) [I think this will perform best]
	- Apply the VGG-16 or VGG-19 net on each cropped fish image.
	- Extract activations from second-to-last layer
	- Save Tensor to binary matrix
	- Repeat with different layers. Find the best performing activations to steal
	- (As you get deeper towards the end of the net it becomes more specific to ImageNET data. e.g. Dogs)
- SIFT Features
	- Extract SIFT features on image crop
	- Save 128-tensor to binary matrix
- Train Multiclass SVM
	- Plug features extracted above into SVM implementation
	- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html


CLASSIFICATION WORKFLOW:
- Take picture
- Run detector to obtain fish crop. If failed ask to take picture again.
- Run Classifier on fish crop

APP
- Design a simple app, like dead simple cause we have no time lol
- Takes picture, pings server with picture, returns histogram of probable fish species
